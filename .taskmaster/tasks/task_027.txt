# Task ID: 27
# Title: Auto-Configuration System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement intelligent defaults and automatic configuration detection
# Details:
Build project type detection using file patterns and package managers. Implement automatic port allocation with conflict detection. Create secure API key storage with encryption. Add MCP server auto-discovery by scanning .mcp.json files. Build configuration inheritance (global -> project -> agent). Add smart suggestions based on project analysis.

# Test Strategy:
Test detection accuracy across different project types. Verify port allocation avoids conflicts. Test API key encryption and retrieval. Validate MCP discovery finds all servers. Test configuration inheritance precedence.
