# Task ID: 26
# Title: GUI-CLI Integration Bridge
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 24, 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure complete feature parity and real-time synchronization between GUI and CLI
# Details:
Share business logic through @magents/core package. Implement unified command execution layer. Create WebSocket/SSE bridge for real-time updates. Add command palette in GUI mapping to CLI commands. Build activity log showing all operations from both interfaces. Implement conflict resolution for concurrent operations.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for CLI commands executed from GUI. Verify real-time sync with parallel CLI/GUI operations. Test conflict resolution scenarios. Validate command palette executes correctly. Check activity log captures all operations.
