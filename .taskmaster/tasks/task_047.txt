# Task ID: 47
# Title: Implement Project-Based Task Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 46
# Priority: medium
# Description: Filter tasks based on selected project and restrict assignment to same-project agents
# Details:
Modify taskMasterIntegrationService.getTasks to accept and use project path parameter. Load tasks only from selected project's .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json. Filter agent list when assigning tasks to show only same-project agents.

# Test Strategy:
API tests for filtered task loading, assignment validation tests, multi-project integration tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update task service API [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify task loading service to accept project path parameter
### Details:
Update taskMasterIntegrationService.getTasks signature to accept projectPath. Modify implementation to read from project-specific .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json. Handle missing task files gracefully.

## 2. Implement task caching per project [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.1
### Description: Cache tasks by project to improve performance
### Details:
Create task cache keyed by project ID. Invalidate cache on task updates. Implement cache expiration strategy. Consider using React Query or similar for cache management.

## 3. Filter agents by project for assignment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Show only same-project agents when assigning tasks
### Details:
When displaying agent list for task assignment, filter by projectId. Modify agent selection UI to only show eligible agents. Add clear messaging about project restrictions.

## 4. Add assignment validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.3
### Description: Validate task assignment to ensure same project
### Details:
Add backend validation to prevent cross-project task assignment. Return clear error messages for invalid assignments. Update API documentation with constraints.

## 5. Update task UI with project context [pending]
### Dependencies: 47.1, 47.3
### Description: Show project information in task displays
### Details:
Display project name in task cards. Show agent's project in assignment UI. Add visual indicators for project boundaries. Include project in task detail views.
