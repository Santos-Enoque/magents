# Title: Cloud Deployment Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 24
# Priority: low
# Description: Enable deployment and management of agents in cloud environments
# Details:
Implement 'magents deploy --cloud' command with provider selection. Add state persistence using cloud storage. Create secure tunnel for remote agent access. Build cloud-specific Docker images with smaller footprint. Add support for AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, and Azure Container Instances. Implement cost estimation before deployment.

# Test Strategy:
Test deployment to each cloud provider. Verify state persistence and restoration. Test remote access security and performance. Validate cost estimates match actual usage. Test container scaling and resource limits.
