# Task ID: 24
# Title: Core CLI Commands Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement three essential commands with progressive complexity options
# Details:
Implement 'magents create <name>' with instant agent creation using defaults. Add 'magents assign' for automatic task generation based on project analysis. Create 'magents start' to launch agents in Docker containers. Add --mode flag supporting simple/standard/advanced modes. Implement --dry-run for preview. Add progress indicators for long operations. Create interactive mode for missing parameters.

# Test Strategy:
CLI integration tests for all commands. Test mode switching preserves data. Verify dry-run doesn't make changes. Test progress indicators show accurate status. Validate interactive prompts work correctly.
