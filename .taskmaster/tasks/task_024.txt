# Task ID: 24
# Title: Core CLI Commands Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 21, 22, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement three essential commands with progressive complexity options
# Details:
Implement 'magents create <name>' with instant agent creation using defaults. Add 'magents assign' for automatic task generation based on project analysis. Create 'magents start' to launch agents in Docker containers. Add --mode flag supporting simple/standard/advanced modes. Implement --dry-run for preview. Add progress indicators for long operations. Create interactive mode for missing parameters.

# Test Strategy:
CLI integration tests for all commands. Test mode switching preserves data. Verify dry-run doesn't make changes. Test progress indicators show accurate status. Validate interactive prompts work correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement `magents create <name>` command with instant agent creation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core 'magents create' command that instantly creates agents using smart defaults and minimal user input
### Details:
Implement the primary agent creation command that accepts a name parameter and creates an agent with intelligent defaults. Include automatic project detection, default branch selection, smart naming conventions, and minimal configuration requirements. The command should work out-of-the-box without requiring extensive setup or configuration from users.

## 2. Add progressive complexity modes (--mode simple/standard/advanced) [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Implement the --mode flag system that provides different levels of configuration complexity based on user expertise
### Details:
Create a progressive disclosure system with three modes: simple (minimal options, smart defaults), standard (common configurations exposed), and advanced (full feature access). Include mode switching capabilities, data preservation across mode changes, and contextual help for each mode level. Ensure users can upgrade from simple to advanced modes without losing data.

## 3. Implement `magents assign` command for automatic task generation [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Create the 'magents assign' command that automatically generates and assigns tasks based on project analysis
### Details:
Build the task assignment command that leverages the MagentsTaskManager wrapper to automatically analyze projects, generate relevant tasks, and assign them to agents. Include project type detection, automatic PRD generation, task prioritization, and intelligent task-to-agent matching. Integrate with TaskMaster functionality while hiding complexity from users.

## 4. Create `magents start` command to launch agents in Docker containers [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Implement the container orchestration command that launches agents in Docker environments with proper resource management
### Details:
Build the agent startup command that creates and manages Docker containers for agents. Include container lifecycle management, volume mounting, network configuration, health monitoring, and resource allocation. Integrate with the Docker runtime implementation and ensure proper container cleanup and restart policies.

## 5. Add utility features (--dry-run, progress indicators, interactive mode) [done]
### Dependencies: 24.2, 24.3, 24.4
### Description: Implement supporting utility features that enhance user experience and provide operational transparency
### Details:
Add --dry-run functionality for previewing changes without execution, implement real-time progress indicators for long-running operations, create interactive mode for missing parameters with smart prompts and validation. Include operation cancellation, progress persistence across page refreshes, and comprehensive user feedback systems.
