# Task ID: 9
# Title: Add Basic Agent Management Actions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement basic agent management actions (start, stop, view details, delete) in web interface
# Details:
Add action buttons/menus to agent dashboard for basic operations. Implement agent deletion with confirmation dialog. Add agent details modal/page showing full agent information. Integrate with backend API endpoints for each action. Add proper error handling and user feedback. Ensure actions update dashboard in real-time.

# Test Strategy:
Test all agent actions work correctly (delete removes agent and tmux session), confirmation dialogs prevent accidental actions, error handling displays appropriate messages, real-time updates reflect changes immediately
