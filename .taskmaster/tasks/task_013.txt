# Task ID: 13
# Title: Enhance Agent Creation Form with Project Selection
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Upgrade existing agent creation form to include project selection, git branch management, and validation
# Details:
Modify AgentCreateForm to include DirectoryBrowser integration for project selection. Add git branch selection dropdown with create-new-branch option. Implement real-time validation for project path, branch names, and agent IDs. Add project metadata display (repo name, current branch, last commit). Include form steps/wizard pattern for better UX. Add preview of what will be created before submission.

# Test Strategy:
Test project selection updates available branches, branch validation prevents invalid names, form wizard guides users through process, preview shows accurate information, submission creates agents correctly
