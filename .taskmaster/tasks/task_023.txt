# Task ID: 23
# Title: Unified Data Model Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create single source of truth for agent and task data shared between CLI and GUI
# Details:
Design flattened UnifiedAgentData schema replacing complex nested structures. Implement SQLite database for persistent storage with automatic migrations. Create DataSync service for real-time updates between CLI and GUI. Build migration tool to convert existing agent configurations. Add data validation layer with Zod schemas. Implement atomic operations to prevent race conditions. Create backup/restore functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Schema validation tests for all data operations. Migration tests from old to new format. Concurrent access tests for race conditions. Real-time sync tests between multiple clients. Backup and restore functionality tests.
