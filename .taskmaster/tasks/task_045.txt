# Task ID: 45
# Title: Auto-Create Projects for Terminal Agents
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 44
# Priority: medium
# Description: Automatically create projects when agents are created from terminal without explicit project
# Details:
In DockerAgentManager.createAgent, check if projectId is provided. If not, create project using current working directory as path and basename as name. Link Docker volumes to project path. Update agent with auto-created projectId.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for CLI agent creation, tests for project auto-creation logic, Docker volume mapping tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add project detection logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Detect when agent is created without explicit project
### Details:
In DockerAgentManager.createAgent, check if projectId is provided in options. If not, flag for auto-creation. Get current working directory for project path.

## 2. Implement project auto-creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.1
### Description: Create project based on current directory when not specified
### Details:
Use process.cwd() as project path. Use path.basename() for project name. Generate unique project ID. Set appropriate defaults for project settings.

## 3. Link Docker volumes to project [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.2
### Description: Ensure Docker volumes are created from project path
### Details:
Update Docker volume mounting to use project path as base. Ensure agent worktree is within project directory. Update volume permissions appropriately.

## 4. Update agent with project association [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.2, 45.3
### Description: Associate newly created agent with auto-created project
### Details:
After project creation, update agent record with projectId. Update project's agentIds array to include new agent. Ensure bidirectional relationship is maintained.

## 5. Add user feedback for auto-creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 45.4
### Description: Provide clear feedback when project is auto-created
### Details:
Show message indicating project was auto-created. Display project name and path. Suggest using explicit project for better organization. Log auto-creation for debugging.
