# Task ID: 18
# Title: Add Agent Creation Progress Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement real-time progress indicators and status updates during complex agent creation operations
# Details:
Create ProgressTracker component with step-by-step progress display. Implement WebSocket-based real-time updates for long-running operations. Add detailed status messages for each creation step (git operations, tmux setup, configuration copying). Include error recovery and retry mechanisms. Add operation cancellation capability. Implement progress persistence across page refreshes.

# Test Strategy:
Test progress tracking shows accurate status, real-time updates work correctly, error messages are informative, cancellation stops operations cleanly, progress persists across page refreshes
