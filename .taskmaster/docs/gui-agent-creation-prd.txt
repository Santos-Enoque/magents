# GUI Agent Creation Workflow - Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement

The current GUI treats agents as standalone entities, but every agent is intrinsically tied to a project (git repository) and potentially to specific TaskMaster tasks. Users cannot properly create agents from the GUI because:

1. Agent creation requires selecting/browsing local directories
2. Directory must be validated as a git repository
3. Branch selection and validation is needed
4. TaskMaster integration is not available in GUI
5. Project association is missing
6. Advanced configuration options are not accessible

## Solution Overview

Create a comprehensive GUI workflow that matches CLI functionality while providing enhanced UX for:
- Directory browsing and git repo validation
- Project management and association
- TaskMaster integration and task assignment
- Advanced agent configuration options
- Progress tracking for complex operations

## Core Features Required

### 1. Project Management System
- Project discovery and registration from local file system
- Git repository validation and metadata extraction
- Project-agent relationship management
- TaskMaster configuration detection and integration

### 2. Enhanced Agent Creation Flow
- Multi-step wizard with directory selection
- Git branch browsing and creation
- TaskMaster task selection and assignment
- Advanced configuration options (Docker, environment, etc.)
- Real-time validation and progress feedback

### 3. TaskMaster Integration
- Automatic TaskMaster environment detection
- Task browsing and selection interface
- Task preview with details and requirements
- Automatic task briefing and context setup
- GitHub issue integration (optional)

### 4. Advanced Configuration Management
- Docker container options
- Environment variable configuration
- Port allocation and management
- Claude settings inheritance and customization
- MCP configuration management

## Success Criteria

1. Users can browse and select local directories from GUI
2. Git repositories are automatically validated and configured
3. TaskMaster tasks can be browsed and assigned to agents
4. Agent creation matches CLI functionality with enhanced UX
5. All advanced options available in CLI are accessible in GUI
6. Progress tracking shows real-time status of complex operations
7. Error handling provides clear guidance for resolution

## Technical Requirements

### Backend APIs
- Project discovery and validation endpoints
- Directory browsing API with git repository detection
- TaskMaster integration API (task listing, details, assignment)
- Enhanced agent creation API with full option support
- Configuration validation and inheritance APIs

### Frontend Components
- File system browser component
- Multi-step agent creation wizard
- Project management interface
- TaskMaster task browser and selector
- Advanced configuration forms
- Progress tracking and status components

### Integration Points
- Git repository validation and branch management
- TaskMaster CLI integration for task operations
- Docker container management (if enabled)
- Claude configuration copying and inheritance
- MCP configuration setup and validation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Project Management)
- Backend project discovery and validation
- Frontend directory browser component
- Git repository detection and metadata extraction
- Basic project-agent association

### Phase 2: Agent Creation Enhancement
- Multi-step agent creation wizard
- Git branch selection and creation
- Basic TaskMaster integration
- Progress tracking for operations

### Phase 3: TaskMaster Integration
- Complete TaskMaster API integration
- Task browsing and selection interface
- Automatic environment setup
- Task briefing and context generation

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Docker configuration options
- Environment variable management
- Port allocation and management
- GitHub integration and issue creation
- Batch operations and templates

This comprehensive approach will provide a GUI experience that surpasses CLI capabilities while maintaining full compatibility with existing workflows.
